# Summary of Data Set
Submit a 1-2 page summary (Word document, .docx) of your EDA.

You summary should include the following information:

- Summary of the data set that, at a minimum, answers the following questions: What is the unit of analysis? How many observations in total are in the data set? How many unique observations are in the data set? What time period is covered?

- Brief summary of any data cleaning steps you have performed. For example, are there any particular observations / time periods / groups / etc. you have excluded?

- Description of outcome with an appropriate visualization technique.

- Description of key predictors with appropriate visualization techniques that compare predictors to the response. You should investigate all predictors in your data as part of your project. For the purpose of this assignment, pick the one or two predictors that you think are going to be most important in explaining the outcome. Your selection of predictors can either be guided by your domain knowledge or be the result of your EDA on all predictors.
