# Summary of model selection and results
Submit a  summary (Word document, or PDF) of your EDA.

You summary should include the following information in a professional way:

- Justify your model choice based on how your response is measured and any observations you may have made in your EDA.

- Report the model's test error rate using one of the techniques we discussed in lecture. Justify your choice.

- Based on the estimated test error rate, discuss how well the model fits the data.

- Use the model to make predictions for at least three cases of interest.
