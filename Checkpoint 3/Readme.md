# Summary of alternative model(s) selection and results
Submit a 1-2 page summary (Word document, .docx) of your EDA.

You summary should include the following information:

- Justify your model choice based on how your response is measured, any observations you may have made in your EDA, and the first model you have estimated. When selecting an alternative model, choose one that is appropriate for your response. Do not change the response to estimate an alternative model.

- Report the model's test error rate using one of the techniques we discussed in lecture. Justify your choice.

- Based on the estimated test error rate, discuss how well the model fits the data.

- Use the model to make predictions for at least three cases of interest.
